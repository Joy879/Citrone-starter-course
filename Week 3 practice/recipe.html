  <h1>UGALI, NYAMA CHOMA, and KACHUMBARI</h1>
  <p>Kenya does not have a single dominant culture that symbolizes the country.
     Instead, there are many cultures with their own histories and traditions. 
     Therefore, Kenyan dishes vary from region to region within the country too. 
     <strong>Ugali</strong> is a staple and served with many dishes, as it is across many African regions.
     There are many Kenyan dishes that are considered the National dish. 
     <strong>Nyama choma</strong> is grilled meat, which can be considered as an unofficial national dish—usually goat or sheep—while kuku choma is grilled chicken.
     It is usually cooked over an open fire and eaten with ugali and <strong>kachumbari (salsa)</strong>, maharagwe (bean stew) and mchicha (shredded spinach).

          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the water in a pot on high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the water gets warm, add half the amount of cornmeal, and stir it. Continue to stir until it thickens and becomes porridge. When you start seeing bubbles, cover the pot and leave it to cook for 4 minutes on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and add the rest of the cornmeal. Stir it. As you mix in the rest of the cornmeal it will become harder, almost like play dough, continue to mold it until all the flour is mixed in, and mash all the lumps.</li>
        <li>Then spread it flat at the bottom of the pot as much as possible, cover, and put back on the fire on medium heat.</li>
        <li>After 4 minutes, open and stir it up in order to turn it, and spread it back on the bottom, cover, and put back on the heat. Repeat twice.</li>
        <li>Mold it in the middle of the pot into a nice round shape, and place on a serving dish.</li>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Get a good charcoal fire going on your grill.</li>
        <li>Stir 1 teaspoon salt into 1 ½ cups warm water for sprinkling on the meat.</li>
        <li>Place your meat on the grill. </li>
        <li>Monitor and turn regularly to ensure even cooking. Allow it to brown evenly.</li>
        <li>Occasionally sprinkle with salty water to keep from drying.</li>
        <li>Once cooked to medium, sprinkle generously with salty water and wrap it in foil. Make sure the foil is well sealed, with no holes.</li>
        <li>Place it back on the grill (in the foil) to continue cooking for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The meat will steam inside the foil as it continues to cook and will remain soft and moist.</li>
        <li>When ready, unwrap, and cut the meat into bite-sized pieces for serving.</li>
